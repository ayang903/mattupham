Meta's Glasses Recording You & More", 'url': 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=1p7_4ZuP0Y4', 'text': "this past week has been wild there have been so many new announcements coming out and I'm really excited to catch you all up with it I mean from meta releasing or sharing about their new AI glasses with Rayban how first of all we'll dive into this in a second but how is it going to be controlled people recording you you can now record with these glasses you're never going to know if you're being recorded we'll get into that in a sec here and another one I want to share with you is about Humane AI pin it made its debut on the runway in Paris fashion of course and this company fun fact was founded by someone who used to work at open AI can see there's competition there also two Amazon just invested billions billions with a be of dollars into this company as they are working on a new model for AI which they are saying is going to be 10 times more powerful than anything that exists today I'm telling you we got to dive into [Music] this [Music] all right you know I got to give you the whole Spiel before we get into it make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career related topics leave in the comments any other videos you want me to create let me know if you are enjoying these Tech news it seems like you are but give me feedback let me know what you like about them what you don't like okay enough of me talking well I'm going to talk more but let's get into the tech news meta recently had their event and there was a ton of different innovators creators seite individuals who attended one of the biggest announcements as I mentioned earlier on was about the collaboration between Rayban and meta now these glasses are not the first of their kind we've seen many variations of them even from meta and Rayban this is not the first time something like this is being released it is more so the improvements which they are saying improvements on audio and cameras they also are saying there is 150 different custom frames and lens combinations so they're lighter and more comfortable now at first I've seen some videos circulating online of people who have gotten their hands on these I'm like that's really cool you can create a lot of interesting content but is that line gone where there's anything private nowadays and my mind automatically goes to how these could be used to record people without consent what if you didn't know about these glasses or you didn't know or recognize that there was a camera in there that could cause a lot of issues I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this is this something that you would get I mean the flip side is this you know I I could see these being really helpful for a variety of reasons kind of I don't know I need to get your thoughts on this all right we are moving on to Humane the new AI pin which made its debut on none other than the Naomi Campbell during Paris fashion week and earlier in this video I shared with you how one of the founders used to work at open AI even to make it more intertwined if you will is one of the main backers for Humane is none other than the Sam Alman I mean no surprise here it's all very closely intertwined so this pin can sit on your jacket we've also seen photos of it sitting on your uh your pants and the whole thing around it is it's this piece of Hardware that you don't need to answer you don't need to physically interact with so it is sitting on you but it will then shine uh if someone is calling you or texting you and you can use your hand to actually read or interact with it actually let's insert here a little clip of uh the founder of Humane and giving a little demo of what it's capable the legendary tech journalist Walt mber wrote in his final column that he felt that soon one day technology would become invisible and that the computer would disappear and we agree sorry this is my wife I'm going to have to get this hello hey babe hey Bethany how's it going good are you a Ted yeah I'm on the red circle right now actually oh great good luck and don't forget to mention me I won't babe thank you love you love you too bye bye it's going to get different in a minute so there's been no announcements as to when this is being released to the public but I do expect it actually to be pretty soon I've seen this in the works for I believe it was last year last year it feels like last year that I first heard about it so it's been in the works for a while now I'm sure many years prior and uh they aren't saying when it's going to be released but they do say that privacy for them comes first so one of the things that I thought of is okay so this device is going to always be listening to me it's kind of like a wearable device so it's even more it feels more invasive than say like Alexa or any of these other smart speakers so they go on to say that there are certain words that you can ED to ensure it is not always listening you can turn it off essentially by saying words such as uh a no wake word so you can pick what that is and uh their vision is Building Products which place trust at the center so they are really trying or they're saying they're really trying to put trust first and I'm really curious to see how they are able to do that with a device that needs to be listening to you it's very curious would you get one of these I'm also wondering if these have the power to replace iPhones I really do think they might but curious to hear if you disagree with me all right Tesla released their new model their cheaper or cheapest actually model this actually didn't really make big news and I'm curious if it's because it literally just was announced or if no one cares anymore but they released their new electric SUV that doesn't necessarily need to break your bank or that's what they say anyway so here is the cost of this so they are saying the starting price for the rwd model Y is $443,000 Which is 3,700 less than the AWD model that was recently discontinued they say or went away was it discontinued I think it was also too the good news is though it does qualify for the federal EV tax credit I'm Canadian I don't know these tax credits but apparently you get one for $7500 if you purchase this EV electric vehicle I don't know it doesn't really do it for me I'm kind of I'm all about the idea behind electric of course but Tesla just kind of leaves me with this like doesn't excite me very much I'm curious though for any Tesla owners out there am I missing something next vehicle should I switch to Tesla let me know all right the last thing I want to touch on is more of an interesting thing that I've been reading a lot about not necessarily hot in the news right now but I think something that you'll find very interesting which is around Quantum Computing so we've seen Quantum Computing the topic of it the subject of it in the news a lot lately because we are making great leaps and balance with it which is really exciting I mean it still takes me a minute to fully comprehend that Quantum to to be able to this like combust my brain I'm used to computers being able to do zero or one true or false but having this quantum computer being able to have multiple scenarios at once is really I don't know it's mind-blowing maybe it's just me but I think it's really cool but the downside or the flip side to that is around encryption so I was reading a lot about this recently here on Forbes actually it says quantum computers could make today's encryption defense less and honestly this could be done in a matter of seconds so let's go into it a little bit here what they are saying and this isn't just from Forbes this is just research I'm just reading this specific article is that because encryption relies on complex mathematical problems that take an immense amount of time for traditional computers to be able to solve I mean almost impossible it's not but it just feels that way it takes so long when you're able to use something like Quantum Computing this could break encryption in a matter of minutes they are saying so now there is the flip side which is great which means they are working on putting up guard rails for these quantum computers to not be able to do that but I've just really gone down this Rabbit Hole when it comes to Quantum Computing it's really fascinating to me I know there's a ton different more work that needs to be done around Quantum Computing we aren't where we are you know but I do think there's going to be a boom just like there was with AI I think there's going to be one around quantum computers and I just really hope it's in the near future kind of maybe I shouldn't be hoping that but it just seems it's very fascinating to me curious to hear if you have done any reading up on Quantum Computing your thoughts on it I'm really geeking out about this right now so if you have leave in the comments and let's have a full-on conversation about it all right that is it for this week's Tech news it was kind of a lighter week for the number of things that have happened but the things that did happen made a big impact make sure to leave in the comments your thoughts feedback questions on anything we covered today and I'll see you very soon hit that subscribe button so I will see you really soon bye [Music]

my own horn you all know\xa0\xa0 that so it is with some hesitation I am pulling\xa0\nthe curtain aside to reveal my Channel's dangly\xa0\xa0 bits so that I might toot myself today this is\xa0\nthe monetization page for a YouTube video as it\xa0\xa0 stands today and these are my typical settings\xa0\nset thusly because my m.o. for how I do YouTube\xa0\xa0 is to generally not do things that I myself would\xa0\nnot like like or appreciate I am not a big fan of\xa0\xa0 ads but I recognize that they help support many\xa0\nchannels including my own so I do turn ads on\xa0\xa0 skippable ads that is but I disable non- skippable\xa0\nads as well as midrolls and that's despite YouTube\xa0\xa0 telling me many many times that midrolls could\xa0\nmake them and Me by extension more money but I\xa0\xa0 hate it when a mid Roll pops up and interrupts\xa0\na video almost as much as I hate non-skippable\xa0\xa0 ads but YouTube has decided that starting in\xa0\nNovember they will make the call instead of me\xa0\xa0 about what ads to serve now I can at least still\xa0\nopt out of midrolls it seems which I intend to\xa0\xa0 do but before these changes roll out I wanted\xa0\nto apologize in advance to anyone who might\xa0\xa0 get served a stupid long ad at the beginning\xa0\nof one of my videos starting next month and\xa0\xa0 to recommend Fire fox and you block origin for\xa0\nbetter control over how your eyeballs are sold\xa0\xa0 on the internet but thanks for letting me get\xa0\nthat off my chest and now on with the tech news excellent today's video is brought to you by Micro\xa0\nCenter this is one of my favorite places to buy PC\xa0\xa0 parts so if you're building or upgrading your\xa0\nPC I highly recommend making your way down to\xa0\xa0 one of their 25 retail stores in the US they have\xa0\nconsistently competitive prices and an excellent\xa0\xa0 selection of PC hardware and other Tech goodies\xa0\nand they have a custom PC Builder on the Micro\xa0\xa0 Center website use it to spec out your rig and\xa0\nit will show you Parts in store at your nearest\xa0\xa0 location while ensuring compatibility then you\xa0\ncan pick up in store or have their Pros assemble\xa0\xa0 it for for you so click the sponsor Link in\xa0\nthe description to find a Micro Center near\xa0\xa0 you speaking of tooting my own horn did you note\xa0\nthat I always put time stamps on all my videos\xa0\xa0 too with a chapter starting after my burned in\xa0\nad Integrations so you can easily skip that as\xa0\xa0 well double tap with two fingers to jump to the\xa0\nnext chapter if you're on mobile I talked last\xa0\xa0 week about how there aren't a ton of big launches\xa0\nexpected in Q4 but what launches might actually\xa0\xa0 happen enthusiasts with Deep Pockets might be\xa0\nexcited to hear that the thread Ripper Pro 7000\xa0\xa0 series of CPUs are rumored to launch October\xa0\n19th these Zen 4 based processors code named\xa0\xa0 storm Peak will sport as many as 96 cores and 192\xa0\nthreads 384 megab of cache and 128 PCI Express\xa0\xa0 Gen 5 Lanes combined with 8 or four Channel ddr5\xa0\nsupport via the new platform which comes in tx50\xa0\xa0 or wx50 variants but with the launch only about\xa0\na week and a half away there have been precious\xa0\xa0 few leakages of new motherboards apart from\xa0\nan ASRock TRX 50 model outed by eec listings\xa0\xa0 back in September so don't be surprised if thread\xa0\nRipper Pro 7,000 debuts as an oem only option with\xa0\xa0 DIY options limited to somewhere between zero and\xa0\nnone unless you want to purchase and disassemble\xa0\xa0 a0 to $220,000 plus pre-built workstation from\xa0\nan Enterprise integrator like Lenovo or HP last\xa0\xa0 generation thread Ripper Pro 5000 series\xa0\nCPUs were out for about 5 months via OEM\xa0\xa0 M before they were made available to the public\xa0\nas a standalone purchase which is partially why\xa0\xa0 pricing for the 7,000 series is still a mystery\xa0\nand consider that the thread Ripper 5000 series\xa0\xa0 Flagship the ryzen thread Ripper 5995 WX listed\xa0\nfor $6,500 initially and it still goes for over\xa0\xa0 6,000 today so if this rumor is true the launch\xa0\nwill likely be subdued for the DIY crowd due to\xa0\xa0 pricing and availability but all that aside I\xa0\nam still quite curious to see what the 96 core\xa0\xa0 thread Ripper Pro 7995 WX can do another launch\xa0\nthat could be happening soon is Intel's Arc a580\xa0\xa0 GPU the middle child in the ark lineup that has\xa0\nbeen notably missing since it was announced more\xa0\xa0 than a year ago video cards.com went so far\xa0\nas to claim that the GPU had likely been shelv\xa0\xa0 after it no-showed at Intel's Innovation event\xa0\nin September but hope has been renewed thanks\xa0\xa0 to listings spotted by the nefarious Twitter user\xa0\nknown as Momom Moore us one listing is from the\xa0\xa0 German price comparison site giz house where an\xa0\nack Challenger OC model can be found and Sparkle\xa0\xa0 apparently also shared images of their a580\xa0\norc with videoc cards.com directly both gpus\xa0\xa0 are two fan two slot cards with dual 8 Pin Peg\xa0\npower connectors despite their supposed 175 wat\xa0\xa0 TDP so now the real question apart from the actual\xa0\nlaunch date of course is how much these will cost\xa0\xa0 given that the ark a750 has now seen sale prices\xa0\nbelow $200 if the a580 is 150 or even 170 bucks it\xa0\xa0 could become a go-to for entry level builds and\xa0\nit even has 8 GB of vram just like nvidia's RTX\xa0\xa0 460 TI which costs $400 it is perhaps a symptom\xa0\nof the lack of big PC Hardware launches that I\xa0\xa0 will now be talking about phones specifically\xa0\nthe Google pixel 8 and pixel 8 Pro which were\xa0\xa0 announced at their event on Wednesday along with\xa0\nan updated pixel Watch 2 pricing is $700 for the\xa0\xa0 pixel 8 and 1,000 for the 8 Pro 100 bucks more\xa0\nthan the pixel 7 was at launch but those phones\xa0\xa0 weren't designed for the generative AI era nor did\xa0\nthey feature the latest tensor G3 processor which\xa0\xa0 can do AI better so you can AI your pictures\xa0\nand ultimately use the term AI as frequently\xa0\xa0 as possible in your presentation the pixel 8\xa0\nSports a 6.1 in 1080x 2400 display with 2,000\xa0\xa0 nits Peak brightness they the 8 Pro is 6.8 in 1344\xa0\nby 2992 resolution and 2400 nits brightness both\xa0\xa0 screens can go up to 120 HZ refresh rate too the\xa0\ntemperature sensor is a unique feature on these\xa0\xa0 phones but I question just how close you need to\xa0\nget it to say boiling liquid to get an accurate\xa0\xa0 reading and there are some software tricks to pair\xa0\nwith the upgraded 50 megapixel main camera such as\xa0\xa0 computational audio that can remove background\xa0\nnoises from a video such as a barking dog or the\xa0\xa0 best take phot photo replacement tool that lets\xa0\nyou choose faces from a series of shots and swap\xa0\xa0 them in so you can actually get a family photo\xa0\nwhere no one is sneezing and none of the kids\xa0\xa0 are making those faces that kids like to make\xa0\nduring family photos and while that feature\xa0\xa0 itself probably makes it worth the price for some\xa0\nparents I was most intrigued by Google's promise\xa0\xa0 to provide 7even years of software updates for\xa0\nthe pixel 8 and not just security patches but OS\xa0\xa0 and feature updates as well it seems like a push\xa0\naway from the trend of getting a new phone every\xa0\xa0 year which is why I will not be getting a pixel\xa0\n8 because I still have a pixel 6 and it works\xa0\xa0 just fine speaking of things that work just fine\xa0\nputting the shorter stories in the latter half of\xa0\xa0 the show just kind of makes sense and hence we\xa0\nhave Tech briefs amd's FSR 3 with fluid motion\xa0\xa0 frames AKA frame generation debuted late last\xa0\nweek without much in the way of official review\xa0\xa0 as it is still technically a preview release but\xa0\nas we might have expected Tim over at Hardware\xa0\xa0 unboxed posted an assessment of FSR 3 on Friday\xa0\nand it's not quite a glowing review there are\xa0\xa0 multiple frame pacing problems vsync off is broken\xa0\ncurrently and a variable refresh rate only really\xa0\xa0 works if the output frame rate is higher than\xa0\nyour monitor's refresh rate severely limiting\xa0\xa0 the tech useful application depending on your\xa0\nhardware setup refresh rate and resolution of\xa0\xa0 course and while FSR 3's broad compatibility is\xa0\nhelpful Nvidia still has an edge in response time\xa0\xa0 at least until AMD can get their anti-ag feature\xa0\nworking properly with frame generation on so let's\xa0\xa0 hope AMD can fix what's ailing FSR 3 and according\xa0\nto Frank from the Radeon team updates are on the\xa0\xa0 way soon godspeed here's another follow-up from\xa0\nlast week the French competition Authority raided\xa0\xa0 nvidia's offices over in the land of powdered\xa0\ncroissants and marmalade last Wednesday and now\xa0\xa0 the EU is piling on with its own investigation\xa0\nalbeit an informal one there are concerns about\xa0\xa0 anti-competitive behaviors in the burgeoning AI\xa0\nchip Arena where Nvidia is undoubtedly the front\xa0\xa0 runner but is nvidia's position simply the natural\xa0\nresult of them kicking AI ass or have they engaged\xa0\xa0 in subterfuge and skull duggery to thwart their\xa0\nwouldbe competition this certainly wouldn't be the\xa0\xa0 first example of such behavior in the industry if\xa0\ntrue for example only about 2 weeks ago intel was\xa0\xa0 forced to finally pay a 400 million doll fine\xa0\nstemming from their anti-competitive practices\xa0\xa0 pushing AMD around basically between November 2002\xa0\nand December 2006 so maybe in 20 years Nvidia will\xa0\xa0 get what's coming to them as well allegedly\xa0\nhere's a bit of industry news according to\xa0\xa0 the Korean business publication chosunbiz tsmc\xa0\nand Samsung are having problems with yields on\xa0\xa0 their 3 nmet nodes tsmc has between 3 and five 3\xa0\nneter nodes going and Samsung has three and while\xa0\xa0 they've been up and running in some capacity for\xa0\nabout a year yields are still in the 50 to 60%\xa0\xa0 % range with anything below 70% deemed very poor\xa0\nby industry standards time will tell if tsmc and\xa0\xa0 Samsung can make the necessary tweaks to pump\xa0\nthose yield numbers up especially if we want\xa0\xa0 to retain hope that nextg gpus like nvidia's RTX\xa0\n50 Series will be available with decent volume as\xa0\xa0 they are rumored to make use of 3 nmet technology\xa0\nlastly I want to inform you all of some sad news\xa0\xa0 and I know this will affect quite a few of my\xa0\nregular viewers my friends it saddens me to let\xa0\xa0 you know that that your first generation Apple\xa0\nSmartWatches and I know many of you sprung for\xa0\xa0 the solid gold versions that went for10 to $17,000\xa0\nare now obsolete sure you were likely disappointed\xa0\xa0 when Apple discontinued software updates for\xa0\nthese devices in 2018 only 3 years after their\xa0\xa0 debut but long-term plans that might have included\xa0\nreselling them for a tidy sum have now been dashed\xa0\xa0 as well leaving you poor hapless customers who\xa0\nwere able to afford spending five figures on a\xa0\xa0 watch in 2015 out in the cold I guess there's\xa0\nno recourse now except to package those tragic\xa0\xa0 paper weights up and ship them over to my PO box\xa0\nwhich is listed in the video's description because\xa0\xa0 while your Apple watch might be worthless now I\xa0\nguarantee that my gratitude to you much like the\xa0\xa0 armband and several other choice components\xa0\non that watch is worth its weight in gold so\xa0\xa0 there you have it guys Tech news

Overflow & more', 'url': 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=AhNjKsT3cKg', 'text': "[Music] thank you here are the top five biggest things to happen in Tech this past week from AI helping a quadriplegic man move again to well smart glasses that can help you with your dating life but also too acing that technical interview let's get into it oh before we do hit that subscribe give this video a like and leave any video suggestions in the comment okay now let's get into it now this first story gets pretty wild quickly which is AI knows what you are typing there have been studies that were recently conducted to see how AI was able to detect or pick up what keystrokes are being typed when you're in a zoom call or if someone is in earshot from you in this paper it states that with zoom audio to go on an AI can decode keystroke sounds with a startling 93 accuracy and it's able to pick up exactly what you are typing now I'm sure the inevitable is going to occur with this potential risk and danger yes there's pros to it but also too let's face it there's a lot of cons especially when it comes to cyber security one example they share in this article is really how this could be used for example you're in an airport typing in your password and there is a hacker sitting close to you with a microphone captures that audio from your keystrokes the rest is history and this might sound so far-fetched like we are in this cyber movie and this isn't going to happen but it's already happening today this is where we are at and cyber security implications are going to be huge with this and they actually tested this out the researchers pressed 36 keys on the MacBook Pro a total of 25 times each recording the keystrokes on two different mediums a nearby iPhone microphone and zoom audio and the accuracies of picking up these keystrokes were between 95 and 93 now this next story it hits close to home as a developer which is stack Overflow has seen a massive decline in users since different apps such as chat GPT Bard you get the point have been released and not only are they competing against these AI models but some of them were actually trained on stack Overflow data and of course Elon Musk had to make his way into this news by calling it death by llm now stack overflow's CEO is responding to this in two main ways one being the phenomenal community resource he is saying that the reason why stack Overflow in many ways became so popular you don't have to spend a large amount of hours into the night trying to figure things out you have this amazing community resource stack Overflow is responding by saying that it wants to be paid for its training data I mean they're giving away all this data and losing out on it so it makes sense where they want to get paid he also shared out a tweet which I think is really interesting and gets you thinking this is what it said he also recently tweeted this out and it really gets your mind going when stack Overflow is fully dead due to AI where will AI Labs get their training data from and this is a great point it's one of those things where the snake is eating its own tail they are getting this data from stack Overflow but they are killing stack Overflow as they are doing that where are they going to get the data once this is done does that even matter to them oh the irony in this next story this one was it's too good it's too good as someone who works from home remote and is a huge remote fan I had to include this one Zoom wants its employees to return back to office very ironic considering they make their money on individuals working remotely now here's what they had to say about it we believe that a structured hybrid approach meaning employees that live near office need to be on site at least two days a week to interact with their teams now although this is very ironic considering what their technology is all about they are one of the last big companies or where there's still a few hanging in there but most big companies nowadays are going back to this hybrid approach which by the way is terrifying as someone who likes to work from home this next story I shared in short form on social media but I had to include it in this week it's mind-blowing we talk a lot about AI on here and sometimes it gets more into the negatives of AI and what that is and I always try and keep it positive and this story here with AI is one of those really positive use cases of how it can change the world and people's lives Mr right here AI helps quadriplegic man move and feel again so what surgeons were able to do is implant a chip into this individual's brain and let me let me read for you exactly what they did surgeons implanted microchips into Thomas's the quadriplegic brain in the regions that control movement and touch sensation in the hand the chip interfaces with AI algorithms that relink his brain to his body and spinal cord through this they are able to interpret Thomas's thoughts and translate them into actions now this is wild and such a great use case of how we can help people with this technology with AI and now you can see Thomas is able to move his arm when he starts thinking about it and signaling from his brain this was impossible before he had this surgery it was very successful and it's getting a lot of media attention rightfully so now one of the lead researchers on this project here's what they had to say this is a game changer our goal is to one day give people with paralysis the ability to live Fuller independent lives you can think of maybe you have a friend family member acquaintance who has been impacted with something like this being able to have more independent be function more independently through this technology I think it's really just at the cusp of what is possible now this next one is for anyone who's in the dating scene or needs a little help maybe with dating Stanford students created some glasses smart glasses that can display the output of opening eyes gpt4 this is something that I kind of wish I had during my technical interviews especially when we get into really specific algorithms being able to see the solution on my glasses and they can't tell that I have the solution where do I order a pair the device is called Riz GPT and this is how it works it listens to your conversations and it tells you exactly what to say next so you can see on screen when you are having a conversation text will be generated in real time for you so here let me share with you this tweet of an example of what is possible with these glasses now this is able to work this way because opening eyes speech recognition software whisper allows the glasses to feed speech directly to the chatbot which can generate answers in a matter of seconds really now there still is when I was watching videos a little bit of pause even one or two seconds in a conversation can feel like a lot but we are definitely on our way to making these an everyday product which has the potential to really impact a lot of areas from your dating life your job interview that's why I keep on coming back to the job interview would be the biggest thing how you do negotiations having all that information right in front of you in real time the possibilities are really endless what do you think though do you think something like this product these glasses should be allowed for the public to access or is it giving us too much information at our fingertips that will impact really if we put any effort into learning or using our own lives all right those are the top five biggest things to happen in Tech this past week Tech is moving so quickly so I try and keep these updates for you to stay informed in a fun and engaging way that you don't have to

'https://youtube.com/watch?v=XfnyOrNNnx8', 'text': "[Music] welcome to Tech news briefing it's Wednesday September 27th I'm Zoe Thomas for The Wall Street Journal Monopoly seems to be top of mind for regulators and big tech companies right now it's not a game though the future of how we do things online could be impacted by two Landmark Anti-Trust cases one against Amazon the other targeting Google we'll tell you how both are playing out starting with that Amazon case the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states have sued the company alleging the online retailer illegally wields Monopoly power that keeps prices artificially High locks sellers into its platform and harms its rivals our reporter Dana mattioli has been covering Amazon for a long time and she joins me now with the details Dana can you tell us more about the ftc's claims so the FTC is making two claims in its lawsuit the first is that amazon.com is pay to play for sellers so essentially in order to be successful as a seller on amazon.com you need to be part of Amazon's FBA Logistics program which comes with lots of fees and you also need to buy advertising which comes with its own set of fees and then there's another claim that because Amazon demands that its sellers have the lowest price of their goods on the internet it artificially raises prices everywhere else for consumers has Amazon responded to these charges so Amazon says that the lawsuit that the FTC filed is wrong on the facts and the law and that they look forward to making that case in court Dana this is a big moment for chair Lena Khan when it comes to Anti-Trust cases can you remind us why yeah Selena Khan Rose to fame back in 2017 when she was still just a law student at Yale and she wrote a law review article for the Yale Law Journal alleging that Amazon is a monopoly and needs to be broken up or that the antitrust laws need to change and it went viral which doesn't often happen for law review journals cut to present day she is the chair of the FTC which is the regulator overseeing Amazon so this is sort of a full circle moment for her she kind of cut her teeth on a national stage making some of these allegations and now the lawsuit has finally landed that was wsj reporter Dana mattioli the FTC is asking a court to prohibit Amazon from engaging in activity that it claims gives the e-commerce giant monopolistic control but the lawsuit doesn't say whether the agency will ask the court to break up the company Khan declined to say whether it would in a briefing with reporters and staying on the Anti-Trust front Google's Hardball tactics with smartphone makers have been on display in court in the company's Anti-Trust case in Washington the justice department is focused on Google's deals with smartphone makers to automatically direct people to its search engine these date back to 2001 when Google began offering to split revenue generated when search users click on ads with phone makers a few years later Apple asked Google for an amendment to the contract that would allow it to present users with several default search engine options including Yahoo according to an email presented by the justice department Google told Apple no and it would not split its ad Revenue if the iPhone maker offered multiple options a Google spokesman pointed to a previous statement saying the company competes for default placement Apple declined to comment the case is expected to play out over several months but it comes at an important moment Google turns 25 today our reporter miles Krupa is with me to talk about this moment for Google miles the company has been around for two and a half decades it's a verb what's changed for the company in that time in some ways it's the same Google that it's been for years it has 90 percent of the search Market that supports a massive advertising business that still makes the majority of the company's Revenue but they're just sort of signs that Google as it is today might not be what it is in a few years so one this generative AI boom kicked off by the release of chat GPT clearly has had Ripple effects throughout Google seemingly every product at Google whether it's Gmail and docs or the company's core search engine or even YouTube they're all moving fast to integrate generative AI products with search especially this new thing they're doing called search generative experience is easily the most radical change we've seen to the search engine in decades it's still what Google is calling an experiment that will provide you a sort of multi-paragraph summary generated by an AI program instead of just sending you to Links around the internet and so that's a big change for the company and when you pair that with the fact that Google is going through this antitrust trial in DC really the first major antitrust trial of its kind since Microsoft in the 1990s and there's a potential there for this judge to rule that Google needs to change its business practices or even break off part of the company there's enough movement around Google's core search business that it's really hard to say even just in a few years what the company might look like and let me ask you about the trial that's going on now because they're looking back at agreements that Google made decades ago what more do we expect to kind of play out over the next couple of weeks well the doj is calling a bunch of different Witnesses Google will start making its defense and probably call a bunch of its Executives including people who work on the search team so there's still a lot of testimony to go through what's been a recurring theme over the past few days and weeks is how much testimony is being held behind closed doors so the judge it seems has taken a fairly permissive stance towards what the companies claim are confidential proprietary business matters that must be sealed from the public so we'll get more of that and that makes it a difficult trial for reporters to cover and for the public to really follow closely but we've gotten some interesting details on how Google has interacted with some of these Partners like Apple Samsung major phone carriers to ensure that its search engine basically remains ubiquitous the doj the evidence as it's been presented so far is giving the impression certainly that competitors like ducktuckgo or even Microsoft's being or having trouble competing with Google because of the way it's been able to negotiate these agreements over many years all right that's our reporter miles Krupa thanks for joining us thank you all right that's it for Tech news briefing Today's show was produced by Anthony bansi with supervising producer Melanie Roy I'm Zoe Thomas for The Wall Street Journal we'll be back tomorrow thanks for listening [Music] [Music]"}, {'title': 'Meta rolls out new AI and virtual reality technologies at developer conference', 'url': 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=GlN1O3JzJ9U',

HE SAYS THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED  ON VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY , AS WELL AS ARTIFICIAL  INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES.  NOTABLE NEW ADDITIONS INCLUDE  AI PERSONAL ASSISTANT THAT  PEOPLE CAN INTERACT WITH WHEN  USING MESSAGING APPS.  TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT  THIS, I WANT TO BRING IN WILL  NIGHT.  BRING YOU.  GOOD MORNING.  A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN MARK  ZUCKERBERG TALKED ABOUT THE  META BURSTING THE FUTURE AND HE  FELT STRONGLY ABOUT IT AND HE  CHANGED  HIS COMPANY TO META.   THERE IS LITTLE BIT OF  SNICKERING.  A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE NOT SURE  ABOUT THAT, BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN  TO SOME OF HIS OPENING  STATEMENT TO THIS CONFERENCE,  IT SOUNDS LIKE HE IS DOUBLING  DOWN BUT WE WANT TO PLAY A  LITTLE SOUND.  >> EVEN THOUGH WE ARE  CONSTANTLY TOUCHING THE DIGITAL  WORLD, IT IS MOSTLY THROUGH  SCREENS AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT  INHABITS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  LANE FROM OUR PHYSICAL LIGHTS.  I THINK THAT ONE OF THE MOST  INTERESTING QUESTIONS FOR OUR  INDUSTRY OVER THE COMING  DECADES IS GOING TO BE, HOW DO  WE UNIFY THOSE EXPERIENCES?  THE PHYSICAL THAT WE HAVE WITH  THE VITAL DIGITAL WORLD THAT IS  MORE COHERENT AND BETTER THAN  ANYTHING WE HAVE TODAY?  >> HE IS TALKING A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT AUGMENTED REALITY AND  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.  WHERE ARE WE WITH THE META?   WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT  DOES HE HOPE IT WILL BE?  HOW WILL AUGMENTED REALITY PLAY  INTO THIS?  IT IS A BIG QUESTION ABOUT  WHETHER MARK ZUCKERBERG IS  DREAM IS CLOSE TO BEING A  REALITY.  >> THE METAVERSE HASN'T REALLY  TAKEN OFF IN A WAY THAT  HE WAS  HOPING. AT THE SAME TIME, WE  ARE SEEING SOME PROGRESS.  APPLE HAS ANNOUNCED ITS APPLE  VISION PRO HEADSET AND THE NEW  HEADSET,  THE META QWEST THREE  IS TRYING TO ADVANCE BY  INCORPORATING  SOME REAL WORLD  WITH THE VIRTUAL WORLD, SO YOU  ARE JUST PUTTING IT ON AND  DISAPPEARING, BUT YOU CAN HAVE  AN AUGMENTED REALITY EXPERIENCE. THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO KEEP  THE VISION GOING.  META HAS THIS IDEA  THAT IT IS  THE FUTURE OF COMPUTING AND  THEY WANT TO BE THE ONE TO BE  THE GATEKEEPER.  AT THE SAME TIME, THIS EVENT  YESTERDAY REALLY SAW THE  ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SLEW OF AI  PRODUCTS, WHICH REFLECT THE  FACT THAT AI IS THE PARADIGM  THAT IS TAKING OFF RIGHT NOW.  >> PART OF THE ISSUE WITH THE  META-VERSE AND AUGMENTED  REALITY IS THAT YOU NEED THE  GADGETS.  META IS NOT A GADGET COMPANY,  BUT HERE THEY ARE.   THEY ARE PARTNERING UP WITH  GADGET COMPANIES.  THEY PRESENTED A COUPLE OF  INTERESTING GADGETS.  >> THEY PRESENTED THIS NEW  HEADSET, WHICH IS LIGHTER AND  INCORPORATES CAMERAS, WHICH YOU  SEE THE REAL WORLD.  YOU CAN USE THIS TO DO NEW WAYS  OF INTERACTING WITH A COMPUTER  OR NEW WAYS OF MEETINGS.  THEY ALSO ANNOUNCED THE SMALL  GLASSES WHICH IN OPERATE THEIR  VIRTUOUS -- VIRTUAL ASSISTANT.  IT IS A BIG QUESTION.  SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO  TRY TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY AND  SOFTWARE, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T  SOMETHING THAT HAS POTHOLED YET. >> ANY MENTION OF THREAD IN THE  OPENING REMARKS?  IT SEEMS LIKE IT STARTED OFF  STRONG, THEN FIZZLED REALLY  FAST.  >> THREADS  HAS FALLEN A LITTLE  BIT AND MOST WERE STILL BY THE  VIRTUAL REALITY AND HEADSET  STAFF AND ALL OF THIS AI STUFF,  WHICH META IS INVESTING HEAV"}]
